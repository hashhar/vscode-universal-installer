# Visual Studio Code Universal Installer

This is a script written in Python 3 which had the original aim of being included into the official Visual Studio Code software but wasn't due to ideological differences.

It downloads the latest release of Visual Studio Code and installs it for you. You can also download the Insider channel releases.

The script is completely interactive and doesn't take any flags so as to make it easier for newbies.

### Usage (it needs python3 in order to work):
```
./install.py
```
